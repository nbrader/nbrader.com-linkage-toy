# Linkage Toy

**Linkage Toy** is an interactive WebGL-based simulation for exploring 2D mechanical linkages. Built with Unity, this tool lets you manipulate bar-joint structures in real-time by clicking and dragging joints or bars, adjusting lengths, and observing dynamic behavior. Ideal for educational purposes, mechanical intuition, and fun experimentation.
